## Overview:

The healthcare space is growing by leaps and bounds. According to a report, global healthcare expenditure is expected to reach USD 10 trillion by 2022.
There were close to 2.4Bn medical mobile apps in 2017 in the U.S. alone. It is estimated to reach 11.2Bn by 2025, as per the research by Statista.
Here, we have developed a disease predicting web app which using the concept of machine learning makes predictions about various diseases like Cancer, Heart, Diabetes, Kidney and Liver.

## Preview:

## Goals:
Patients will be able to share their medical report securely with doctor and receive quick results. Doctors will be able to test the report and different results using most efficient available trained Machine Learning and Deep Learning backend endpoints and analyse the results. Our ML/AI algorithm will train in real time using Machine Learning from the prediction given by various Doctors using the platform. The patients will also be able to track their Medical Records and view it any time without any hassle.


## Model Selection:
  1. Cancer: Random Forest Classifier

## Conclusion & Future Work:

In the year 2020, artificial intelligence has become powerful tools for all types of companies. Although large corporations have been a leader in the use of machine learning and AI, a large number of small businesses are already using these technologies to enhance their competitiveness through efficiency, innovation, and productivity.
